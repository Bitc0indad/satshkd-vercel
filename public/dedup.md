```
import pandas as pd
import json
```
These two lines import the pandas library, which is a popular Python library for working with data, and the json library, which is used to read JSON data from a file.

```
def get_data_from_file(datafile):
    with open(datafile, '+r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df
```
This function, get_data_from_file(), takes a filename as an input and returns a pandas DataFrame containing the data from the file. It first opens the file in read mode (+r) using the open() function and reads the contents using json.load() to load the JSON data from the file. It then creates a pandas DataFrame from the JSON data using pd.DataFrame(), and returns the resulting DataFrame.

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    datafile = "hkd_historical"
    df = get_data_from_file(datafile)

    # Check for duplicates
    duplicates = df.duplicated(keep="first")
    
    # Remove duplicate rows
    df = df[~duplicates]
    
    # Print the updated DataFrame
    print(df)

    print(df.duplicated().any())   #Output: False
```
This block of code checks for duplicate rows in the DataFrame returned by get_data_from_file(). It first checks for duplicates using the duplicated() method, which returns a boolean Series indicating which rows are duplicates. The keep="first" argument specifies that the first occurrence of each duplicated row should be considered non-duplicate.

Next, it uses the boolean Series to remove the duplicate rows using boolean indexing. Specifically, it uses the ~ operator to invert the boolean Series and select only the rows that are not duplicates.

Finally, it prints the updated DataFrame and checks if there are any remaining duplicates using the duplicated().any() method. Since the output is False, there are no duplicates remaining in the DataFrame.

Again the output of the last line ```print(df.duplicated().any())``` will always be False. This is because the duplicated() function checks for duplicates across all columns of the DataFrame, and the code is not passing any arguments to the function. By default, keep="first", which means that only the first occurrence of each set of duplicated rows is considered non-duplicated, and all subsequent occurrences are considered duplicates.

In the code, duplicates are removed by assigning the inverse of duplicates to df, which means that all duplicated rows are removed from df. Therefore, after removing duplicates, the DataFrame should not contain any duplicates and df.duplicated().any() should return False.

So, the last line print(df.duplicated().any()) is just checking if there are any duplicates in the updated DataFrame after removing duplicates, and the expected output is False.

```
import pandas as pd
import json

def get_data_from_file(datafile):
    with open(datafile, '+r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df

if __name__ == "__main__":
    datafile = "hkd_historical"
    df = get_data_from_file(datafile)

    # Check for duplicates
    duplicates = df.duplicated(keep="first")
    
    # Remove duplicate rows
    df = df[~duplicates]
    
    # Print the updated DataFrame
    print(df)

    print(df.duplicated().any())   #Output: False
```
